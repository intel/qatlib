selects the QAT manager policy. This determines how resources should be allocated to each process using the qatlib library.
The default POLICY 0 allocates one virtual function (VF) from each physical function (PF) endpoint to each process. This should be selected for best performance.
A POLICY of 1 allocates a single VF to each process. This should be selected for maximum scalability.
Any other POLICY value allocates that number of VFs to each process.
