This package includes:
* libqat: user space library for QAT devices exposed via the vfio kernel driver
* libusdm: user space library for memory management
* qatmgr: user space daemon for device management
* Sample codes: applications to demo usage of the libs

## Insecure Algorithms
The following algorithms are considered insecure and are disabled by default.
* AES-ECB
* SHA-1
* SHA2-224
* SHA3-224
* RSA512/1024/1536
* DSA
* Diffie-Helman
* Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms with less 256 bits
* SM4-ECB

To enable these algorithms, use the following configuration option:
   * `--enable-legacy-algorithms`

## Deprecated Features & Planned Deprecations
* The following configuration option will be deprecated after 2023:
  * `--enable-legacy-lib-names`

## Setup
Please refer to [INSTALL](INSTALL) for details on installing the library.

## Supported Devices
* 4xxx, 401xx and 402xx (QAT GEN 4 devices)
* 420xx (QAT GEN 5 devices)

Earlier generations of QAT devices (e.g. c6xx, dh895xxcc, etc.) are not
supported. Please refer to [QATlib User’s Guide](https://intel.github.io/quickassist/qatlib/requirements.html#supported-devices) for more information
on supported devices.

## Limitations
* For simplicity, only one configuration file is used by qatlib. For guidance
  on how to use this to allocate resources for processes, please refer to
  Configuration and Tuning section in [QATlib User’s Guide](https://intel.github.io/quickassist/qatlib/index.html).

The following features are not currently supported:
* Dynamic instances
* Intel® Key Protection Technology (KPT)
* Event driven polling
* More than 16 processes per end point (16 is the maximum)
* accumulateXXHash when combined with autoSelectBestHuffmanTree
* accumulateXXHash in Decompression or Combined sessions
* Only 2MB Hugepages are supported. A client can not allocate more
  than 2MB in a single allocation with hugepages enabled.

## Environmental Assumptions

The following assumptions are made concerning the deployment environment:
* Users within the same processing domain must be trusted, i.e.: on the same
  host or within the same virtual machine, users must trust each other.
* The library can be used by unprivileged users if those users are included in
  the 'qat' group.
* DRAM is considered to be inside the trust boundary. The typical memory
  protection schemes provided by the Intel architecture processor and memory
  controller, and by the operating system, prevent unauthorized access to these
  memory regions.
* A QuickAssist kernel driver for the supported device is installed, which has
  discovered and initialized the device, exposing the VFs. This driver is
  included in the Linux kernel, see [QATlib User’s Guide](https://intel.github.io/quickassist/RN/In-Tree/in_tree_firmware_RN.html#qat-kernel-driver-releases-features) for information about
  which kernel to use.

## Examples
Example applications that showcase usage of the QAT APIs are included in the
package (quickassist/lookaside/access_layer/src/sample_code).
Please refer to [Intel® QuickAssist Technology API Programmer's Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/709196/intel-quickassist-technology-api-programmer-s-guide.html).

## QATE-106085
| Title      | GEN - A QATlib process fails to start a 4xxx device on kernel v6.1 LTS |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference #   | QATE-106085 |
| Description   | The process fails to start with an error "Failed to get enabled services" |
| Implication   | The process fails to run. |
| Resolution    | Use any later LTS kernel or use a different version of qatlib |
| Affected OS   | Linux - only applies to v6.1 LTS |
| Driver/Module | QATlib – Only applies to v24.09 and v25.08. On v24.09 compression services fail to run, while on v25.08 both Crypto and Compression services fail to run. Only applies to 4xxx devices as support for other devices was only introduced in later kernels. |

## QATE-106084
| Title      | GEN - A QATlib v25.08 process fails to start a 4xxx device on kernel v5.15 LTS |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference #   | QATE-106084 |
| Description   | The process fails to start with an error "Detected not compatible PF driver" |
| Implication   | The process fails to run. |
| Resolution    | Use any later LTS kernel or use a different version of qatlib |
| Affected OS   | Linux - only applies to v5.15 LTS |
| Driver/Module | QATlib – Only applies to v25.08. Only applies to 4xxx devices as support for other devices was only introduced in later kernels. |

## QAT20-40469
| Title      | DC - Incorrect Reporting of Programmable CRC Capability |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference #   | QAT20-40469 |
| Description   | The API `cpaDcQueryCapabilityByType` incorrectly indicates that programmable CRC capability is only supported in the compression direction. |
| Implication   | Users may incorrectly assume that programmable CRCs are not supported in the decompression direction, potentially limiting the use of this feature. |
| Resolution    | Customers can ignore the unsupported status returned by this API for decompression. Programmable CRCs are supported in both compression and decompression directions. |
| Affected OS   | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA – Data Compression. |

## QATE-106040
| Title      | CY – using AES-CCM authenticated encryption without Additional Auth Data can cause undefined behaviour. |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference #   | QATE-106040 |
| Description   | If CpaCySymHashAuthModeSetupData.aadLenInBytes is 0 and the AAD buffer passed in CpaCySymOpData.pAdditionalAuthData is less than 32 bytes, then the lib will overwrite bytes after the buffer. The API description is open to interpretation on the buffer size required, but is clear that it must be at least 16 bytes. However, bytes from byte 16..31 may be overwritten if aadLenInBytes = 0. |
| Implication   | This may result in undefined behaviour if the application had data stored after the buffer. |
| Resolution    | For CCM case the minimum AAD buffer size must be 32 bytes. |
| Affected OS   | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA – Crypto |

## QATE-102747
| Title      |       GEN - Intel QAT Concurrent Initialization Failure in Standalone Mode        |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-102747 |
| Description | Concurrent initialization of the qatlib process in standalone mode may fail with an error message like: “err: Open vfio file /dev/vfio/481 failed!” This issue arises due to resource contention, particularly involving systemd-journald, which can hold the mutex required for VFIO operations. |
| Implication | Users may experience failures during the initialization of the qatlib process, leading to unsuccessful attempts to utilize QAT resources. This can affect applications relying on QAT for cryptographic or data compression operations, potentially causing delays or requiring manual intervention. |
| Resolution | The following may help to mititgate this issue: (1) Use kernel v6.14.5+, as this doesn't acquire the device mutex in journald or disable systemd-journald dev-log and restart it. (2) In standalone mode, instantiate QATlib processes sequentially to avoid contention. |
| Affected OS | Linux |
| Driver/Module | QATlib |

## QATE-102390
| Title         | GEN – [error] validateConcurrRequest() - : Invalid numConcurrRequests  |
|---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reference #   | QATE-102390 |
| Description   | An error occurs in a virtualized environment after VF resources are detached from a running VM (guest) and then re-attached. Following this, the qat service is restarted on the guest to ensure the correct VF resources are used. In rare instances, this leads to a failure in process initialisation with the error: "[error] validateConcurrRequest() - : Invalid numConcurrRequests". |
| Implication   | Processes within the guest fail to start. |
| Resolution    | To resolve the issue, restart the qatmgr on the guest using "sudo systemctl restart qat". If in standalone mode, restart the process manually. |
| Affected OS   | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA – Only on the 420xx QAT GEN 5 device. |

## QATE-3241
| Title      |       CY - cpaCySymPerformOp when used with parameter checking may reveal the amount of padding.        |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-3241 |
| Description | When Performing a CBC Decryption as a chained request using cpaCySymPerformOp it is necessary to pass a length of the data to MAC (messageLenToHashInBytes). With ICP_PARAM_CHECK enabled, this checks the length of data to MAC is valid and, if not, it aborts the whole operation and outputs an error on stderr. |
| Implication | The length of the data to MAC is based on the amount of padding. This should remain private and not be revealed. The issue is not observed when the length is checked in constant time before passing the value to the API. This is done by OpenSSL. |
| Resolution | 1. Build without ICP_PARAM_CHECK, but this opens the risk of buffer overrun. <BR> 2. Validate the length before using the API. |
| Affected OS | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - Crypto |

## QATE-76073
| Title      |         GEN - If PF device configuration is modified without restarting qatmgr, undefined behavior may occur.     |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-76073 |
| Description | When qatmgr is initialized, it reads the current configuration of the PF device. If the PF device configuration is modified without restarting the qatmgr, the updated device configuration is not comprehended by qatmgr. |
| Implication | Undefined behavior may occur. |
| Resolution | If PF device is reconfigured and reloaded, ensure to stop and start the qatmgr. |
| Affected OS | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - General |

## QAT20-38022
| Title      | CY – Edwards and Montgomery curves not supported in PKE operations |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference #   | QAT20-38022 |
| Description   | On some platforms the function cpaCyQueryCapabilities() will report the ecEdMontSupported capability as FALSE and operations using those curves will fail. This case can arise when qatlib is running in a guest and the QAT kernel driver on the host is not a standard Linux in-tree kernel driver. For example, it can occur with some Linux out-of-tree, VMware® ESXi and Windows® QAT kernel drivers. |
| Implication   | PKE operations using those elliptic curves will fail. |
| Resolution    | Fixed in 25.08 |
| Affected OS   | Linux, VMware®, Windows® |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA – Only applies to QAT GEN4 devices. |

## QAT20-40016
| Title      | CY - ZUC-256 (EIA and EEA) on QAT GEN5 is no longer spec compliant. |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QAT20-40016 |
| Description | The Intel implementation of QAT ZUC-256 EEA (Encryption Algorithm) and EIA (Integrity Algorithm) does not align with the 2022 public specification. The initial ZUC-256 specification featured a different initialization scheme, which has since been updated to conform to cryptographic standards and 5G specifications. |
| Implication | Applications attempting to utilize QAT for ZUC-256 EEA and EIA may encounter incorrect values, potentially affecting data integrity and security. |
| Resolution | Issue closed: From QATlib 25.08+ support for ZUC-256 EEA and EIA is no longer provided for QAT GEN5 devices. |
| Affected OS | ALL |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - Crypto - Only applies to QAT GEN5 devices. |

## QATE-76698
| Title      |         GEN - Multi-process applications running in guest will fail when running with default Policy settings.     |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-76698 |
| Description | The default Policy setting results in the first process receiving all available VFs allocated to a guest operating system if the BDFs on the guest do not facilitate qatlib recognising which VFs are from the same PF. In the case of a multi-process application, failures will be observed if all available QAT resources are consumed by the first process. |
| Implication | Multi-process applications running in guest OS may fail with default Policy settings. |
| Resolution | Issue closed: The issue won't arise if the guidance [here](https://intel.github.io/quickassist/qatlib/running_in_vm.html#qat-virtual-function) for specifying guest BDFs is followed. |
| Affected OS | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - General |


## QATE-99637
| Title      |        QAT instances on PCI domains other than 0000 are inaccessible. |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-99637 |
| Description | On multi-domain systems, QuickAssist Technology (QAT) devices that are assigned to PCI domains with identifiers other than the default '0000' are not recognized by the system. Consequently, the QAT instances associated with these devices do not appear available for use or configuration.  |
| Implication | The inability to access QAT instances on non-default PCI domains prevents the utilization of QAT devices in those domains. This limitation restricts the deployment of QAT in environments with complex PCI topologies and can lead to under utilization of available hardware acceleration resources. |
| Resolution | Fixed in 24.09 |
| Affected OS | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - General |


## QATE-99638
| Title      |        Incompatible service to ring configuration with non in-tree QAT kernel modules. |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-99638 |
| Description | QATlib assumes a ring layout corresponding to ring configuration defaults used by the in-tree QAT kernel driver. This assumption is invalid if qatlib is running on a guest and the host has some other QAT kernel driver, e.g. an out-of-tree driver or ESXi driver, which may use different ring configurations. This affects configurations such as ASYM;DC and SYM;DC. All kernel drivers provide ring2service information via pfvfcomms, qatlib should query this rather than rely on an assumed ring layout. |
| Implication | Crypto or compression operations will fail if sent to a ring which doesn’t handle that service. |
| Resolution | Fixed in 24.09 |
| Affected OS | Linux OOT, ESXi, Windows Server |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - General |

## QATE-98551
| Title      |        GEN - On a multi-socket platform, there can be a performance degradation on the remote sockets. |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-98551 |
| Description | On a multi-socket platform, there can be a performance degradation on remote sockets. This can arise when either the threads are not affinitised to the core on the socket the device is on and/or the memory is not allocated on the appropriate NUMA node. |
| Implication | Performance on socket 0 is as expected, but does not scale proportionally on remote sockets. |

## QATE-94369
| Title      |       GEN - SELinux Preventing QAT Service Startup        |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-94369 |
| Description | The qat service fails to start due to SELinux preventing the qat_init.sh script and qatmgr from accessing resources. The issue occurs when the system is running with SELinux enabled, causing insufficient permissions for the qat_init.sh script and qatmgr to function correctly. |
| Implication | This issue affects the proper functioning of the qat service on systems with SELinux enabled, potentially preventing QAT virtual functions (VFs) from functioning. |
| Resolution | The fix is not in the scope of qatlib. Instead there are three possible methods to handle this issue: <br> 1) Update selinux-policy as seen in https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux-policy/pull/1992 <br>2) Disable SElinux <br>3) Update mode to SElinux mode to permissive using following commands: <br>semanage permissive -a qatlib_exec_t<br>semanage permissive -a qatlib_t<br>The audit warnings may be generated, but qatlib will be allowed access to vfio devices. |

## QATE-94286
| Title      |       GEN - Compression services not detected when crypto-capable VFs are also added to VM.        |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-94286 |
| Description | When configuring a system with different services on different QAT end-points, e.g. asym;sym on one and dc on another, and exposing only one of those Virtual Function (VF) types to the Virtual Machine (VM), the application works as expected. However, when VFs of more than one type are passed to the same VM, the application may only recognize one service-type, e.g. it may detect crypto instances, but not compression instances. There is an assumption that all VFs provide the same services if they come from the same PF. However, detecting which PF they come from is based on domain+bus, which is not always a valid assumption on a VM. |
| Implication | This issue prevents the detection of compression services in a virtualized environment when the default kernel configuration is used, and crypto and dc VFs are passed to the VM, potentially impacting the proper functioning of the system. |

## QATE-93844
| Title      |        DC - cpaDcLZ4SCompressBound is not returning correct value, which could lead to a buffer overflow.     |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-93844 |
| Description | CompressBound API (cpaDcLZ4SCompressBound()) is intended to return the maximum size of the output buffer. However, this API is not returning the correct value, which can lead to a lz4s buffer overflow. |
| Implication | Applications may experience buffer overflows even when using the output of compressBound API to allocate output buffers. |

## QATE-93278
| Title      |         GEN - sample_code potential seg-fault, issue #46     |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-93278 |
| Description | cpa_dc_stateless_multi_op_checksum_sample.c missed checking the return value of a memory allocation. See [issue 46](https://github.com/intel/qatlib/issues/46). |
| Implication | In a low memory system, if the memory allocation fails, the process could crash. |
| Resolution | Fixed in qatlib 23.08. |

## QATE-90845
| Title      |         GEN - QAT service fails to start, issue #38 |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-90845 |
| Description | QAT service fails to start. The qat service may fail if the kernel driver's initialization is not fully finished when the service starts. See [issue 38](https://github.com/intel/qatlib/issues/38). |
| Implication | The qatmgr may not detect any or all of the vfio devices. |
| Resolution | Fixed in 23.08. The service waits until the kernel driver has completed initialization of all PFs before starting the service. |

## QATE-78459
| Title      |         DC - cpaDcDeflateCompressBound API returns incorrect output buffer size when input size exceeds 477218588 bytes.     |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-74786 |
| Description | When cpaDcDeflateCompressBound API is called with input size > 477218588 bytes incorrect buffer size is returned. For any buffer input size, the API should not produce output buffer size greater than the max limit (4 GB).   |
| Implication | Incorrect output buffer size is returned instead of error. |
| Resolution | The issue is not present in qatlib. |

## QATE-76846
| Title      |         GEN - Forking and re-initializing use-cases do not work     |
|----------|:-------------|
| Reference # | QATE-76846 |
| Description | Forking and re-initializing use-cases do not work:<br>-icp_sal_userStart()/icp_sal_userStop()/icp_sal_userStart() in single process<br>-icp_sal_userStart()/fork()/icp_sal_userStart() in child.<br> This is the use case in openssh + QAT_Engine. |
| Implication | The process will have undefined behavior in these use-cases. |
| Resolution | Fixed in 21.08. If using release prior to this release and using these flows, call qaeMemDestroy() immediately after icp_sal_userStop() to prevent this issue. |
