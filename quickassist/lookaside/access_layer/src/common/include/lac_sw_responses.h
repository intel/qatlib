 * Busy memory pools calculation functions and dummy responses generation

 * @lld_overview
 *     This component is designed as a set of utility functions for the
 * generation of dummy responses and calculation of memory pools which contain
 * in-flight requests. If the memory pools contain in-flight requests, they
 * will be named as busy memory pools.
 * @lld_dependencies
 *     These utilities rely on OSAL for locking mechanisms and memory
 * allocation. It also depends on the implementation of the memory pool.
 * @lld_initialization
 *     The initialization of the number of busy memory pools should be done
 * prior to the increment.
