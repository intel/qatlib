 * Interfaces exposed by the Prime Component
 *
 * @lld_start
 *
 * @lld_overview
 * This is the Prime feature implementation. It implements four methods for
 * primality test: GCD, Fermat test, Miller-Rabin and Lucas test. The client may
 * require combined testing, i.e. up to one GCD + up to one Fermat + up to
 * 50 Miller-Rabin rounds + up to one Lucas.
 *
 * For Miller-Rabin test the client supplies the array of random numbers.
 * Further processing requires a flat buffer to be associated with each random
 * number. The memory for these flat buffers is assigned internally, as needed,
 * from the pre-allocated memory pool.
 *
 * In addition to the standard check on the parameters supplied by the client,
 * the prime candidate of the acceptable length is tested for MSB and LSB (non-
 * -even number). For Miller-Rabin method, the number of requested rounds must
 * not exceed 50, the supplied random numbers must match the prime candidate in
 * length and have to fall in within 1 and prime-1 (1 < random < prime-1)
 * boundaries.
 *
 * The requests for service are created and chained as necessary for multiple
 * tests in the increasing complexity order: GCD->Fermat->Miller-Rabin->Lucas.
 * The internal functions are called to calculate the function ID for each
 * method and to construct the input/output argument lists before calling the
 * PKE QAT Comms layer to create the request. After all requests have been
 * created, the PKE QAT Comms layer is called to propagate the requests to the
 * QAT.
 *
 * Buffer alignment is handled by the PKE QAT Comms layer.
 *
 * @lld_dependencies
 * - @ref LacPkeQatComms "PKE QAT Comms" : For creating and sending messages
 * to the QAT
 * - @ref LacMem "Mem" : For memory allocation and freeing, and translating
 * between scalar and pointer types
 * - OSAL : For atomics and logging
 *
 * @lld_module_algorithms
 * LacPke_CreateRequest() function takes the parameters for a PKE QAT request,
 * creates the request, aligns the input & output buffer parameters, and fills
 * in the PKE fields.  The request can subsequently be sent to the QAT using
 * LacPke_SendRequest(). In the event of an error this function will tidy up any
 * resources associated with request handle and set it to PKE_INVALID_HANDLE.
 * When the chain of requests is formed (with the same requestHandle) each
 * request structure gets a pointer filled in to point to the next structure
 * (PKE request).
 *
 * LacPke_SendRequest() function sends a PKE request, previously created using
 * LacPke_CreateRequest(), to the QAT. It does NOT block waiting for a response.
 * In the case of synchronous mode the blocking is done elsewhere in the code
 * using wait-queues, and the callback method is handled internally. The
 * callback function is invoked when the response from the QAT has been
 * processed. When a chain of requests is formed, this function sends the
 * request - head of the chain to the QAT. The QAT performs the required
 * operation, in this case the flavour of Prime test. In the event of a
 * successful operation (positive result) the QAT checks if there is a pointer
 * to point to the next request structure, automatically invokes the next
 * request, performs the operation and so on.
 *
 * If any operation returns a negative result then the QAT sends a negative
 * respond back regardless of reaching the end request or not. Similarly,
 * only when all operations result in a positive outcome and the QAT reaches
 * the end of the chain and only then is able to send a positive response.
 *
 * @note
 * The Prime feature may be called in Asynchronous or Synchronous modes.
 * In Asynchronous mode the user supplies a Callback function to the API.
 * Control returns to the client after the message has been sent to the QAT and
 * the Callback gets invoked when the QAT completes the operation. There is NO
 * BLOCKING. This mode is preferred for maximum performance.
 * In Synchronous mode the client supplies no Callback function pointer (NULL)
 * and the point of execution is placed on a wait-queue internally, and this is
 * de-queued once the QAT completes the operation. Hence, Synchronous mode is
 * BLOCKING. So avoid using in an interrupt context. To achieve maximum
 * performance from the API Asynchronous mode is preferred.
