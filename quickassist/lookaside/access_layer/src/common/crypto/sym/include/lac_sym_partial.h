 *
 * Partial packet handling code
 *
 * @lld_start
 *
 * <b>Partials In Flight</b>\n
 * The API states that for partial packets the client should not submit
 * the next partial request until the callback for the current partial has
 * been called. We have chosen to enforce this rather than letting the user
 * proceed where they would get an incorrect digest, cipher result.
 *
 * Maintain a SpinLock for partials in flight per session. Try and acquire this
 * SpinLock. If it can't be acquired return an error straight away to the client
 * as there is already a partial in flight. There is no blocking in the data
 * path for this.
 *
 * By preventing any other partials from coming in while a partial is in flight
 * we can check and change the state of the session without having to lock
 * round it (dont want to have to lock and block in the data path). The state
 * of the session indicates the previous packet type that a request was
 * successfully completed for. The last packet type is only updated for partial
 * packets. This state determines the packet types that can be accepted.
 * e.g a last partial will not be accepted unless the previous packet was a
 * partial. By only allowing one partial packet to be in flight, there is no
 * need to lock around the update of the previous packet type for the session.
 *
 * The ECB Cipher mode, ciphers each block separately. No state is maintained
 * between blocks. There is no need to wait for the callback for previous
 * partial in ECB mode as the result of the previous partial has no impact on
 * it. The API and our implementation only allows 1 partial packet to be in
 * flight per session, therefore a partial packet request for ECB mode must
 * be fully completed (ie. callback called) before the next partial request
 * can be issued.
 *
 * <b>Partial Ordering</b>\n
 * The ordering that the user submits partial packets will be checked.
 * (we could have let the user proceed where they will get an incorrect
 * digest/cipher result but chose against this).
 *
 *  -# Maintain the last packet type of a partial operation for the session. If
 *     there have been no previous partials, we will accept only first partials
 *  -# The state must be set to partial before we will accept a final partial.
 *     i.e. a partial request must have already completed.
 *
 * The last packet type is updated in the callback for partial packets as this
 * is the only place we can guarantee that a partial packet operation has been
 * completed. When a partial completes the state can be updated from FULL to
 * PARTIAL. The SpinLock for partial packets in flight for the session can be
 * unlocked at this point. On a final Partial request the last packet type is
 * reset back to FULL. NOTE: This is not done at the same time as the check in
 * the perform as if an error occurs we would have to roll back the state
 *
 * For Hash mode it is possible to interleave full and a single partial
 * packet stream in a session as the hash state buffer is updated for partial
 * packets. It is not touched by full packets. For cipher mode, as the client
 * manages the state, they can interleave full and a single partial packets.
 * For ARC4, the state is managed internally and the packet type will always
 * be set to partial internally.
